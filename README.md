### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


My name is **Andras Kasznar**, I'm a lead automation engineer from Budapest, Hungary


## Short Bio

Graduated first as an architectural designer Msc, then studied and got a masters degree Computer science.
Helped various companies (Studio IN-EX, Melde, Ã‰te, Merkbau) automate their engineering processes. Currently leading a small team of 5 people at Studio IN-EX.

I held various positions as Lead software developer, BIM expert, Project Manager and Consultant.

Creating automation opportunities with software or low code solutions is the most impactful thing I can bring to the table. So I'm always **on the lookout for companies in the engineering sector** with a desire to automate.
